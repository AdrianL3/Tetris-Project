# Classic Tetris

## Description
Implementation of classic Tetris in Python utilizing Pygame. It includes block spinning, line clearing, scoring, and levels. I used Pygame to create a dynamic user interface that allowed smooth user input and graphical output. 

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

To test if pygame is properly installed.
```bash
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```

## How to Play

Run the code to open the pygame window.
Press any button to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to move left, right, and down. Press the up arrow key to rotate the piece.

High Score will update automatically for each local device. To play again press any button. 'x' to quit the window.
